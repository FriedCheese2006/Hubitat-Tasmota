# Hubitat <<-->> Tasmota Sync Drivers<br/>
Respository for Hubitat Tasmota Sync Drivers. Drivers should be included in Hubitat Package Manager after next manifest sync. <br/>
There are 9 unique drivers that perform realtime native synchronisation between Tasmota 11.X and Hubitat. No special compilation of Tasmota or webhooks required. Drivers use Tasmota triggers and rules to notify Hubitat using a JSON sync whenever a monitored parameter changes such as power, color, dimmer, watts etc.<br/>
1) Color Bulb<br/>
2) Switch\Plug with optional power monitoring.<br/>
3) Dual Relay\Switch\Dual Plug (No power monitoring).<br/>
4) Triple Relay\Switch\Dual Plug (No power monitoring. Not yet included in documentation).<br/>
5) Switch with Dimmer<br/>
6) Switch with Fan<br/>
7) Switch with Sensor<br/>
8) Sensor<br/>
9) 8 Port Relay\Switch (Not yet included in documentation)<br/>
# In addition to the drivers there are 2 documentation files.<br/>
