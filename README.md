# Hubitat <<-->> Tasmota Sync Drivers<br/>
Respository for Hubitat Tasmota Sync Drivers<br/>
There are 7 unique drivers that perform realtime native synchronisation between Tasmota 11.X and Hubitat. No special compilation of Tasmota or webhooks required. Drivers use Tasmota triggers and rules to notify Hubitat using a JSON sync whenever a monitored parameter changes such as power, color, dimmer, watts etc.<br/>
1) Color Bulb<br/>
2) Switch\Plug with optional power monitoring.<br/>
3) Dual Switch\Dual Plug (No power monitoring).<br/>
4) Switch with Dimmer<br/>
5) Switch with Fan<br/>
6) Switch with Sensor<br/>
7) Sensor<br/>
Drivers should be on Hubitat Package Manager shortly. Just waiting for inclusion in the HPM manifest. <br/>
# In addition to the drivers there are 2 documentation files.<br/>
1. How to Upgrade from Tasmota 8.X to Tasmota 11.X <br/>
2. Tasmota Sync Documentation (Installation guide for all drivers) <br/>
